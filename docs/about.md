# About

KITE is an open-source Python/C++ software suite for real-space tight-binding (TB) simulations of electronic structure and bulk quantum transport properties of disordered systems scalable to multi billions of atomic orbitals.

KITE v1.0 is shipped with the following capabilities (for clean and disordered systems in two and three spatial dimensions):

* Quantum Transport: longitudinal and transverse DC conductivities at zero and finite temperature;
* Optical Properties: AC longitudinal conductivity;
* Optical Properties: nonlinear optical susceptibility;
* Unitary time evolution: Gaussian wave-packet propagation (diffusion);
* Electronic Structure: high-resolution density of states (DoS);
* Electronic Structure: local DoS and ARPES;
* Special Features: automated magnetic field in 2D;
* Special Features: lattice perturbations (e.g., strain) and ‘disorder cell’ concept for implementation of multi-orbital/-bond impurities;
* Algorithms: ultra-high-resolution CPGF full spectral (DoS);
* Algorithms: high-resolution CPGF full spectral (finite temperature response functions);
* Algorithms: ultra-high-resolution CPGF single-shot (zero temperature DC conductivity)

For further details on the algorithms and the implementation please refer to S. M. Joao et al., [R. Soc. Open Sci. 7, 191809 (2020)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.191809).

## Getting Started

For understanding the main functionalities, how to setup a TB model and disorder and evaluate the KITE target functions, we suggest you to check the tutorial [Getting Started](tutorial/index.md).
More advanced calculations are explained in [Examples](tutorial/examples). After downloading the repository, you can find a copy of the tutorial scripts under the examples folder.

### Prerequisites

Before installing the code, following prerequisites need to be satisfied:

* Eigen3
* Python (version 3.5 or newer)
* HDF5 (version 1.8.13 or newer)
* Pybinding ([see](https://github.com/dean0x7d/pybinding) the requirements)
* GCC compiler (version 4.8.1 or newer, for the wavepacket functionality gcc 8.0 is needed)
* CMake
* Make

### Installing

After meeting prerequisites and downloading the repository, you can compile the KITE code using the already available Cmake files. Please check the Cmake files first, and if required libraries/packages are installed elsewhere, edit them accordingly. For the full installation procedure, please refer to the [Installation](installation.md) section.
