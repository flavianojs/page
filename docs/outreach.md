##ABOUT

As a woman working in physics and a Brazilian/Argentinian living in Portugal, I understand the importance of diversity and inclusion in STEM fields. I strongly believe that everyone should have the opportunity to pursue their passions and contribute to their field, regardless of their background.

In my experience, having a team with diverse perspectives and experiences leads to more creative problem-solving and innovative ideas. It is essential to create a welcoming environment where people from all backgrounds can feel valued and supported.

I am particularly passionate about promoting STEM education for young girls. I believe that by encouraging girls to explore their interests in science and technology, we can help to bridge the gender gap in these fields and create a more diverse and inclusive future for everyone :smile: 

##GIRLS IN STEM
I am one of the three founders of [**Tem Menina no Circuito**](http://temmeninanocircuito.wordpress.com/), founded in 2013 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. "Tem Menina no Circuito" is a project in Brazil that aims to encourage and empower young girls to pursue their interests in technology and engineering. The project was created to address the gender gap in STEM fields and to provide young girls with the opportunity to explore their potential in these areas.

The project offers workshops, courses, and events that are specifically designed to engage and inspire young girls. Through hands-on activities and interactive sessions, the girls learn about a variety of topics related to technology and engineering, including coding, robotics, and electronics.

!!! tip  "Check the social medias and website of our project:  [:fontawesome-brands-instagram:](https://www.instagram.com/temmeninanocircuito/?hl=en)	             [:fontawesome-brands-facebook:](https://www.facebook.com/temmeninanocircuito/)         [:fontawesome-brands-wordpress:](https://temmeninanocircuito.wordpress.com/)        [:fontawesome-brands-twitter:](https://twitter.com/tem_menina)      [:fontawesome-brands-youtube:](https://www.youtube.com/@temmeninanocircuito1113)"

The project's choice to host its activities in low-income schools makes Tem Menina no Circuito an initiative that provides social inclusion through science. Empowering girls is the path to break the cycle of gender bias and social norms that go beyond daily chores and pervade career choices of parents, most of whom do not have a higher education, who want to decide what is adequate for them and what is "a man thing". The project's impact is on increasing the percentage of girls that seek higher education in any field, with a particular focus on STEM-related fields.

##OTHER OUTREACH ACTIVITIES

Outreach seminars, activities and articles for the general public play a crucial role in promoting science literacy, fostering an interest in STEM fields, and promoting diversity and inclusivity. These activities offer a fun and engaging way for individuals to learn about science and technology, while breaking down barriers and creating opportunities for underserved communities and groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM. Additionally, outreach activities can bridge the gap between the scientific community and the general public, promoting a better understanding of scientific advancements and their impact on daily life. Ultimately, investing in outreach seminars and activities is an investment in the future of our society and our world.

During my career, I participated and engajed in several outreach activities, also wrote articles to the general public. Some of my activities can be seen below, including presentations and interviews (videos), articles to the general public, articles about my presentations and political activism related to science and gender in STEM. Most of the material is in Portuguese.
